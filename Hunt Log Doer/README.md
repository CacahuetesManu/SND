# Hunt Log Doer

## This script requires all files in this folder. MAKE SURE TO TELL SND WHERE THEY ARE (SND OPTIONS --> LUA PATHS)

1. Make sure to set up your paths. Use the Lua path setting in the SND help config.
   
Like this:

2. Change RSR to attack ALL enemies when solo, or previously engaged.

3. Modify the variables in the script to match what you want.
   ```
	--Choose either "class" to do your class log or "GC" to do your Grand Company Log

   	local route = "class"

	--Choose what rank to start 1,2, 3, 4 or 5
	
 	local rankToDo = 1
   
	--Walk or Fly?
   
	local mount = true -- have you unlocked mounts yet?
	local move_type = "walk"
   
   ```

4. If you are interested in improving the coordinates, reach out to me! I can show you how to help.
